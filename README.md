# MECH307--Project
This is the code for my Mechatronics Humidifier 

This code is set up for a humdifier set up with an arduino attached. 
* When you turn on the arduino an LED turns green and a screen displays the humidity and temperature in the room.
* When you press the button a series of events happens
* Press the button 1 time : The LED displays red, a buzzer beeps, and the spout turns clockwise continuously
* Press the button a second time: The LED displays blue, a buzzer beeps, and the spout turns 90 degrees clockwise, 90 degrees counterclockwise, 90 degrees clockwise, and so on
* Press the button a third time: The LED displays green, a buzzer beeps, and the spout turns 45 degrees clockwise, 45 degrees counterclockwise, 45 degrees clockwise, and so on
* Press the button a fourth time: The LED displays blinks red, green, blue continuously, a buzzer plays the intro to "Take On Me" by A-Ha, and the spout turns clockwise continuously
